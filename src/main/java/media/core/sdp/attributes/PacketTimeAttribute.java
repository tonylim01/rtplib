/**
 * a=ptime:[packet time]
 * 
 * <p>
 * This attribute gives the length of time in milliseconds represented by the
 * media in a packet.<br>
 * This is probably only meaningful for audio data, but may be used with other
 * media types if it makes sense. It should not be necessary to know ptime to
 * decode RTP or vat audio, and it is intended as a recommendation for the
 * encoding/packetisation of audio. It is a media-level attribute, and it is not
 * dependent on charset.
