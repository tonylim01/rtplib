/**
 * a=maxptime:[maximum packet time]
 * 
 * <p>
 * This gives the maximum amount of media that can be encapsulated in each
 * packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.<br>
 * The time SHALL be calculated as the sum of the time the media present in the
 * packet represents. For frame-based codecs, the time SHOULD be an integer
 * multiple of the frame size. This attribute is probably only meaningful for
 * audio data, but may be used with other media types if it makes sense. It is a
 * media-level attribute, and it is not dependent on charset.
